# Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target,
# return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target.
# You may return the combinations in any order.
#
# The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times.
# Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
#
# The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations
# that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.
# 1 <= candidates.length <= 30
# 2 <= candidates[i] <= 40
# All elements of candidates are distinct.
# 1 <= target <= 40
